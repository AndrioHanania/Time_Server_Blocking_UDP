# Time_Server_Blocking_UDP

This is a time server (blocking) that works on the UDP communication protocol. The server is written in CPP. 
The customer can send 11 different types of requests, depending on the user input.
All requests deal with questions of times.
The two code files (.cpp) are basically supposed to run on two different projects,
so it will be possible to run both at the same time and get information from the server through the client.
